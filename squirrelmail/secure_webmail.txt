IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/pc35.sse.ws.afnog.org/fullchain.pem. Your
   cert will expire on 2017-08-23. To obtain a new or tweaked version
   of this certificate in the future, simply run letsencrypt-auto
   again with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all*
   of your certificates, run "letsencrypt-auto renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
