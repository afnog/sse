; These are zones that have been delegated from the afnog.guru zone
; to student servers.
;
; Each student zone is configured with
; 
;   @    IN  MX 0 MASTER_SERVER
;   www  IN  CNAME MASTER_SERVER
;
; where MASTER_SERVER is the master server for the zone (e.g.
; MASTER_SERVER is pc5.sse.ws.afnog.org for aang.afnog.guru).
;
; So, for example,
;
;   http://www.aang.afnog.guru/ will retrieve content from pc5
;   postmaster@aang.afnog.guru will deliver mail to pc5
;
; named.conf on each student pc has been simplified, removing
; all the default FreeBSD package nonsense, making it much easier
; to read.
;
; Slave configuration has been tested, and all seems to be working.
