DNS Exercise 1.1
=================

1. Configure the resolver to be used by your server

Check that /etc/resolv.conf contains the address of a resolver that will
work. You can specify more than one if you like, like this:

  search sse.ws.afnog.org
  nameserver 196.200.223.10
  nameserver 196.200.223.12


2. Generate some test DNS queries using "dig"

Run each command below, look for the "ANSWER SECTION" and write
down the result. Make a note of the TTL as well.  Repeat the command.
Is the TTL the same as in the first try?  Are the responses
authoritative?


COMMAND                           RESULT      TTL (1st)   TTL (2nd)
================================  ==========  ==========  ==========


# dig www.tiscali.co.uk. a        __________  __________  __________


# dig afnog.org. mx               __________  __________  __________


# dig www.afrinic.net. aaaa       __________  __________  __________


# dig psg.com. aaaa               __________  __________  __________


# dig <domain of your choice> a   __________  __________  __________


# dig <domain of your choice> mx  __________  __________  __________


# dig tiscali.co.uk. txt          __________  __________  __________


# dig ripe.net. txt               __________  __________  __________


# dig afnog.org. txt              __________  __________  __________


# dig geek.tiscali.co.uk. a       __________  __________  __________


Now send some queries to another caching server. How long did it
take each answer to be received?


COMMAND                                                   RESULT
========================================================  ==========


# dig @8.8.8.8 psg.com. a                                 ___________


# dig @rip.psg.com. yahoo.com. a                          ___________


# dig @zoe.dns.gh. www.afrinic.net. aaaa                  ___________


# dig @<a-server-of-yours> <domain-of-yours> a            ___________


3. Reverse DNS lookups

Now try some reverse DNS lookups. Remember to reverse the four parts
of the IP address, add '*.in-addr.arpa.*', and ask for a *PTR*
resource record. For example, for 216.235.14.38:

# dig 38.14.235.216.in-addr.arpa. ptr

Repeat for an IP address of your choice.

Now try the short form of dig using the '-x' flag for reverse lookups:

# dig -x 216.235.14.38

# dig -x 2001:4900:1:392::38

# dig @<server-of-your-choice> -x <ip-address-of-your-choice>


4. Use tcpdump to show DNS traffic

In a separate window, run the following command (you must be 'root')

# tcpdump -n -s 0 -v udp port 53

(if tcpdump is not installed, you will see a "command not found"
error. You can install tcpdump and avoid the error by typing "apt-get
install tcpdump" as root)

This shows all packets going in and out of your machine for UDP
port 53 (DNS). Now go to another window and repeat some of the 'dig'
queries from earlier. Look at the output of tcpdump, check the
source and destination IP address of each packet

-n            Prevents tcpdump doing reverse DNS lookups on the
	      packets it receives, which would generate additional
	      (confusing) DNS traffic

-s 0          Read the entire packet (otherwise tcpdump only reads
	      the headers)

-i bge0       Which interface to listen on (use ifconfig to determine
	      the name of your ethernet interface)

udp port 53   A filter which matches only packets to/from UDP port 53
