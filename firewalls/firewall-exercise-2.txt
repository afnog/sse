Firewall exercise 2


Block incoming traffic from your neighbour as follows:



1. Change the block rules to do the opposite of Exercise 1 in /etc/pf.conf 

	$sudo ee /etc/pf.conf

	Then paste the following ruleset replacing XX as indicated with the required values
	

#########PF RULES####
	
lan_if="em0"						#Your FreeBSD Network Card
afnog_v4="196.200.208.0/20"  				#Afnog's full IPv4 Block
afnog_v6="2001:43f8:220::/48"  			#Afnog's full IPv6 Block 
bsd_vm_v4="196.200.219.XX"   				#Your FreeBSD VM IPv4 Block
bsd_vm_v6="2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:XX"  	#Your FreeBSD VM's IPv6 Block
neighbour_v4="196.200.219.YY"				#Your neighbour's IPv4 block
neighbour_v6="2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:YY"  	#Your neighbour's IPv6 block
ipv6_ll="fe80::/10"                             	#IPv6 link local on LAN interface for Router Advertisements
set skip on lo0 					#Don't bother processing localhost packets


block in all						#incoming packets blocked unless specified in below rules
pass quick out all                                    #whatever communication this server initiates is allowed

#Things I want to always allow
pass in quick on $lan_if inet6 proto { tcp, udp, icmp6 } from $ipv6_ll to any #allow link local IPv6
pass in on $lan_if from { $afnog_v4, $afnog_v6 } to { $bsd_vm_v4, $bsd_vm_v6 }


##Add your rules block rules below

block in log quick on $lan_if inet6 proto tcp from $neighbour_v6 to $bsd_vm_v6 port 22
block in log quick on $lan_if inet proto tcp from $neighbour_v4 to $bsd_vm_v4 port { 80, 22 }


####END OF PF RULES####

	Save and exit the file. The rules will block SSH over IPv6 and HTTP from your Neighbour to your VM. Ask your neighbour to try the following tests before the PF is reloaded from HIS machine.


	$telnet -6 2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:XX 80
	$telnet pcXX.sse.ws.afnog.org 80
	$telnet -6 2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:XX 22
	$telnet pcXX.sse.ws.afnog.org 22

	Where XX is your VM's IP

2. Now reload PF. Remember it is now loaded but not started:

	
	$sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

	And check which rules it has loaded
	 
	$sudo pfctl -s rules


3. Ask your neighbour to do the following tests:

	$telnet -6 2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:XX 80
	$telnet pcXX.sse.ws.afnog.org 80
	$telnet -6 2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:XX 22
	$telnet pcXX.sse.ws.afnog.org 22

	Where XX is your VM's IP
	
	
	Check your log file as follows: 
	

	$sudo tcpdump -i pflog0 -tte


	OR check the log file


	$sudo tcpdump -r -tte /var/log/pflog
