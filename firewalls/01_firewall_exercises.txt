Firewall exercise 1


1. PF is installed by default in FreeBSD but is not loaded in the kernel. We will load it as well as pflog which we will use to log the rules on the firewall
	
	$sudo kldload pf pflog


2. Now enable PF in /etc/rc.conf as follows by editing /etc/rc.conf with ee:
	
	$sudo ee /etc/pf.conf
	
	#########PF Startup######
	
	pflog_enable=YES                                                   
	pf_enable=YES                                                      
	pf_rules="/etc/pf.conf"                                            
	pflog_logfile="/var/log/pflog" 
	
	#####END OF PF STARTUP ########

	Save and exit the file. Also, create the file that PF will log to:
		
	$sudo touch /var/log/pflog



3. Now add a few rules into the PF file /etc/pf.conf 

	$sudo ee /etc/pf.conf

	Then paste the following ruleset replacing XX as indicated with the required values
	

#########PF RULES####
	
lan_if="em0"						#Your FreeBSD Network Card
afnog_v4="196.200.208.0/20"  				#Afnog's full IPv4 Block
afnog_v6="2001:43f8:220::/48"  			#Afnog's full IPv6 Block 
bsd_vm_v4="196.200.219.XX"   				#Your FreeBSD VM IPv4 Block
bsd_vm_v6="2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:XX"  	#Your FreeBSD VM's IPv6 Block
neighbour_v4="196.200.219.YY"				#Your neighbour's IPv4 block
neighbour_v6="2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:YY"  	#Your neighbour's IPv6 block
ipv6_ll="fe80::/10"                             	#IPv6 link local on LAN interface for Router Advertisements
set skip on lo0 					#Don't bother processing localhost packets


block in all						#incoming packets blocked unless specified in below rules
pass quick out all                                    #whatever communication this server initiates is allowed

#Things I want to always allow
pass in quick on $lan_if inet6 proto { tcp, udp, icmp6 } from $ipv6_ll to any #allow link local IPv6
pass in on $lan_if from { $afnog_v4, $afnog_v6 } to { $bsd_vm_v4, $bsd_vm_v6 }


##Add your rules block rules below

block out log quick on $lan_if inet6 proto tcp from $bsd_vm_v6 to $neighbour_v6 port 22
block out log quick on $lan_if inet proto tcp from $bsd_vm_v4 to $neighbour_v4 port 80


####END OF PF RULES####

	Save and exit the file. The rules will block SSH over IPv6 and HTTP over IPv4 to your Neighbour. PF is not activated right now. Try the following tests before the PF is activated and ENSURE YOU GET A RESPONSE!

	$telnet -6 2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:YY 80
	$telnet pcYY.sse.ws.afnog.org 80
	$telnet -6 2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:YY 22
	$telnet pcYY.sse.ws.afnog.org 80

4. Configure Nagios to monitor your neighbour's PC on IPv4 and IPv6 as follows. Replace YY with your neighbour's IP


	$cd /usr/local/etc/nagios/servers
	$sudo ee pcYY.cfg

##########Neighbour IPv4####

                        alias My Neighbour's Machine on IPv4
                        address 196.200.219.YY
        }

                        check_command check_http
        }
#######END neighbour IPv4#####


	Save and exit the file. Also create a new file for your neighbour for IPv6


	$sudo ee pcYY-v6.cfg

##########Neighbour IPv6#######
define host {
                        use freebsd-server

######End of Neighbour IPv6###########

	
	Save and exit the file. 



	Do the nagios check:

	$sudo nagios -v /usr/local/etc/nagios/nagios.cfg


	And restart nagios
	
	$sudo service nagios restart


	Check you nagios web page to see if the hosts are up on IPv4 and IPv6

5. Now enable PF. Remember it is now loaded but not started:

	$sudo pfctl -e

	Now check if your rules have been loaded

	$sudo pfctl -s rules

	Do you get any output?

	Now load your rules from the file you created with the below command

	$sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

	And check which rules it has loaded
	 
	$sudo pfctl -s rules


6. Enable logging

	$sudo service pflog start
	
	and reload PF

	$sudo service pf restart


	Now try and browse your neighbour's machine over IPv4 and also check SSH over IPv6

	
	$telnet -6 2001:43f8:220:219:196:200:219:YY 22
	

	

	Check the log file as follows: 
	

	$sudo tcpdump -i pflog0 -tte


	OR check the log file


	$sudo tcpdump -r /var/log/pflog
