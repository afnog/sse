Your FreeBSD VM is "bsdpcX.sse.ws.afnog.org"

1. PF is installed by default in FreeBSD but is not loaded in the kernel. We will load it as well as pflog which we will use to log the rules on the firewall
	
		$sudo kldload pf

  Determine your IP address

         $ifconfig vtnet0

2. Now enable PF in /etc/rc.conf as follows by editing /etc/rc.conf with ee:
	
	$sudo ee /etc/pf.conf

Add the following rules

   ##########
	ext_if="vtnet0"                         #the external interface
	me="196.200.219.51"     				##your IP                
	set skip on lo0                         ##avoid the loopback interface
                                                 
	block in all                            #block every thing by default
                                                 
	pass in quick on $ext_if inet proto tcp from any to $me port 22
	block out quick on $ext_if inet proto icmp from $me to 4.2.2.2
	pass out quick on $ext_if inet proto icmp from $me to any
	########



	PRESS ESCAPE
	SELECT "leave editor" (press enter)
	SELECT "save changes" (press enter)


3. Check the rules syntax is correct

   $sudo pfctl -n -f /etc/pf.conf
   
   
   If you get no output then the rules file is correct. The next 2 lines enable the firewall and load the rules
   
   
   $sudo pfctl -e
   $sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
   
 
 4. Try and ping 4.2.2.2. It should fail with a "ping: sendto: Permission denied"
 
 5. Go back and change the "block" to "permit"
 
 6. Once done reload the rules with "sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf"
