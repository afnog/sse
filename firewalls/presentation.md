???

* Computer network security device
* Decided whether packets are allowed or denied
* Uses a pre-defined set of rules

Many devices have built-in firewalls:

* End devices (desktop, laptop and server)
* Routers
* IP-connected devices
* Dedicated hardware

Questions:

* Ask for some examples in each category
* Software and hardware firewalls
* Any unusual examples? Mobile phones, desk phones, toasters?

---

## Advanced Firewalls

* Basic firewalls are packet filters
* Can't always make a decision based on one packet (examples?)
* Stateful firewalls (connection table)
* Application layer (L7) filtering/inspection/IDS
* Redundant firewalls with synchronisation
* VPNs and SSL "VPNs"

???

Decisions that can't be made based on one packet:

* Downloading a forbidden file type
* Downloading a virus
* Sending emails with a virus
* Established connections/Reply packets (information smuggling)
* P2P traffic (bittorrent, skype, etc)

---

## Stateful Firewalls

???

* "Stateful inspection" tracks the state or progress of a network connection.
* These are the states of a TCP connection.
* Most useful for allowing return packets for an open connection.
* Can prevent sneaking in packets after connection closed.
* What about ICMP and UDP? They are not inherently stateful protocols.
* Almost essential for NAT - tracks the internal address corresponding to a connection.

## Participants

Get to know each other!

* Name
* Country
* Work
* Favourite superhero

Close your laptops :)

???

If you're running a workshop, try this game:

* Works best if there's an even number of people on each table.
* Divide the group into pairs.
* Ask the group to put their hands up if they're paired with someone they
already know.
* "If your hand is up and you're left of the person you know, stand up and
  move to the front."
* "Now sit down next to someone you don't know."
* Repeat to check that everyone's paired with someone they don't know.
* Each pair has 2 minutes to get to know the person next to them. Should make notes.
* Then they have to introduce the other person in their pair.

---

## Presentations
