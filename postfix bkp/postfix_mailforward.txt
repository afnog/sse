POSTFIX MAIL GATEWAY
===================

1. ===MX RECORDS==

The mail filter for your domain should have an MX record with a lower priority number


2. ===Configure Postfix====
=============================

Edit Postfix main.cf

	$sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf

	##Add your neighbour's domain to the mydestination entries
	mydestination = pc35.sse.ws.afnog.org, pc39.sse.ws.afnog.org, localhost.sse.ws.afnog.org, localhost


	##Add at the end. This file contains mail routing information
	transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

Save and Exit


	$sudo nano /etc/postfix/transport
	
	##Add your neighbor's server where his mail will be routed to
	pc39.sse.ws.afnog.org   smtp:[pc39.sse.ws.afnog.org]


Save and Exit


Run postmap against the file you created. This should be done each time you add or remove a domain

	$cd /etc/postfix
	$sudo postmap transport
	$sudo postfix reload




ADDITIONAL SECTION
==================

To increase the security restrictions on Postfix, here are a few configs you can add to main.cf


	$sudo vi /etc/postfix/main.cf

	##Add at the bottom

	smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
    		permit_mynetworks,
    		permit_sasl_authenticated,
    		reject_invalid_hostname,
    		reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
    		reject_unknown_sender_domain,
    		reject_non_fqdn_sender,
    		reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
    		reject_unknown_recipient_domain,
    		reject_unauth_pipelining,
    		reject_unauth_destination,
    		permit


Save and exit


Restart Postfix
	$sudo service postfix restart
