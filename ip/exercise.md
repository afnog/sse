## Questions to get you thinking

* What is an IP address?
* What is a port?
* What is ARP?
* Source and Destination Ports
* Ports used by common services
* What is Wireshark?

## Investigations

### Install Wireshark on your computer

Some versions [already downloaded](http://mini1.sse.ws.afnog.org/~inst/wireshark/),
otherwise go to http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

### Capture some traffic

Run a capture for 10 seconds, look at the traffic and analyse it.

If you find something interesting/unusual, send a pcap file to the intructor.

### Learn how to filter captures
