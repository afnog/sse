=====MAIL FILTER - Part 3=======
===========================


1. Setup MailWatch
==================
Copy preconfigured files for Mailwatch from the instructor’s server. The only changes made to these files was to add the MySQL username and password to allow MailWatch to connect to the database.

	$sudo scp afnog@pc39.sse.ws.afnog.org:/home/afnog/*.pm /usr/share/MailScanner/MailScanner/CustomFunctions/


Download MailWatch - MailScanner Frontend

	$cd /home/afnog/
	$wget http://197.4.11.139/1.2.0-mailwatch.zip
	$unzip 1.2.0-mailwatch.zip
	$cd 1.2.0-master
	$sudo mv mailscanner /var/www

Setup MailWatch conf.php (copy preconfigured)

	$sudo scp afnog@pc39.sse.ws.afnog.org:/home/afnog/conf.php /var/www/mailscanner/

Setup MailWatch web page for Apache:


	$sudo sh -c 'echo "Alias /mailwatch /var/www/mailscanner" > /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/mailwatch.conf’



2. Continue MailScanner setup
=============================

You will need the following CPAN module

	$sudo cpan install Encoding::FixLatin

Enable MailScanner

	$sudo nano /etc/default/mailscanner

	##Uncomment the following line:
	run_mailscanner=1

Save and Exit the file


Copy preconfigured MailScanner.conf file
	
	$sudo mv /etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf /etc/MailScanner/MailScanner.conf.backup
	$sudo scp afnog@pc39.sse.ws.afnog.org:/home/afnog/MailScanner.conf /etc/MailScanner/
	
Prepare MailScanner directories (they may already exist)
	
	$sudo mkdir /var/spool/MailScanner/spamassassin && sudo chown postfix:postfix /var/spool/MailScanner/spamassassin
	$sudo chown postfix:www-data /var/spool/MailScanner/incoming
	$sudo chown postfix:www-data /var/spool/MailScanner/quarantine


3. Get clamav updates (they take a long time and we will use a local copy)
========================================================================

Clamav will automatically attempt to obtain fresh antivirus signatures from the Internet via
freshclam after installation. This will take too long for us so please use pre-downloaded signatures for the class.
(No need to do this on a real server)
	
	$sudo service clamav-daemon stop
	$sudo killall -9 freshclam
	$sudo scp afnog@pc39.sse.ws.afnog.org:/var/lib/clamav/* /var/lib/clamav/
	$sudo service clamav-daemon start


4. Setup Postfix and SpamAssassin
================================

Enable SpamAssassin 

	$sudo nano /etc/default/spamassassin

	##Uncomment the following line:
	ENABLED=1


Save and Exit.


Configure Postfix to hold mail first. Effectivly a mail arrives and is put into a hold queue then mailscanner scans the mail for spam or virus content then it is released:

	$sudo nano /etc/postfix/header_checks

	###Add the following
	/^Received:/ HOLD

	Save and Exit

Configure the main.cf file to read the file created above.

	$sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf

	###Add the following
	header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks

	Save and Exit



5. Setup Mailwatch
==================

Set up MailwWatch

	$cd /home/afnog/1.2.0-master


Setup the database. The password is afnog

	$mysql –u root –p < create.sql 

THEN


Setup the mailscanner database, where it will store details on incoming emails

	$mysql –u root –p


You should get the MySQL shell. 

	mysql>

Add the following exactly as it is IN ONE LINE:

	GRANT ALL ON mailscanner.* TO mailwatch@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'afnog';
	GRANT FILE ON *.* TO mailwatch@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'afnog';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	exit

THEN

Login as the Mailwatch user using the credentials used in the Mysql entry above. We will set the username and password to be used to login to the MailWatch web interface. Typically this should be a strong alphanumeric password or passphrase. We will use afnog for this class however:

	$mysql mailscanner -u mailwatch –p

	INSERT INTO users SET username = ‘mailwatch’, password = MD5(‘afnog’), fullname = ’mailadmin’, type = ‘A’;
	exit


Finally, set the rights to the images directory 

	$sudo chown -R root:www-data /var/www/mailscanner/images/
	$sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/mailscanner/images/


6. START everything
====================

	$sudo service postfix restart && sudo service apache2 restart && sudo service mailscanner restart



7. ALWAYS CHECK LOGS
=======================

	
You should also run the SpamAssassin check. Look for errors and fix (if any). It may require you to install a few more 
	$sudo spamassassin -D --lint

You should get similar output at the very end.

	dbg: check: subtests=__BODY_TEXT_LINE,__EMPTY_BODY,__GATED_THROUGH_RCVD_REMOVER,__HAS_FROM,__HAS_MESSAGE_ID,__HAS_MSGID,__HAS_SUBJECT,__KHOP_NO_FULL_NAME,__MISSING_REF,__MISSING_REPLY,__MSGID_OK_DIGITS,__MSGID_OK_HOST,__MSOE_MID_WRONG_CASE,__NONEMPTY_BODY,__NOT_SPOOFED,__SANE_MSGID,__TO_NO_ARROWS_R,__UNUSABLE_MSGID
May 29 12:14:46.384 [12173] dbg: timing: total 1061 ms - init: 798 (75.2%), parse: 0.55 (0.1%), extract_message_metadata: 1.14 (0.1%), get_uri_detail_list: 0.58 (0.1%), tests_pri_-1000: 5 (0.5%), compile_gen: 117 (11.0%), compile_eval: 16 (1.5%), tests_pri_-950: 3.7 (0.4%), tests_pri_-900: 4.0 (0.4%), tests_pri_-400: 3.5 (0.3%), tests_pri_0: 197 (18.5%), tests_pri_500: 45 (4.3%)



You should make sure that MailScanner is working properly and can communicate with ClamAV and SpamAssassin.
Do not run the following command from the root director (/root) as it will produce errors

	$sudo MailScanner --lint --debug

You should see something like this:

	Checking for SpamAssassin errors (if you use it)...
	Using SpamAssassin results cache
	Connected to SpamAssassin cache database


	AND

	Filename Checks: Windows/DOS Executable (1 eicar.com)
	Other Checks: Found 1 problems
	Virus and Content Scanning: Starting
	./1/eicar.com: Eicar-Test-Signature FOUND

	Virus Scanning: ClamAV found 2 infections
	Infected message 1 came from 10.1.1.1
	Virus Scanning: Found 2 viruses
	===========================================================================
	Virus Scanner test reports:
	ClamAV said "eicar.com contains Eicar-Test-Signature"



If all is well then restart everything:

	$sudo service postfix restart && sudo service apache2 restart && sudo service mailscanner restart


And check the log


	$sudo tail -f /var/log/mail.log

You should get similar output

Test that port 25 is open and that Postfix is listening
	$sudo telnet localhost 25


	afnog@pc39:/etc/spamassassin$ sudo telnet localhost 25
	Trying ::1...
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	220 pc39.sse.ws.afnog.org ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)

Type quit to exit



8. LOGIN TO MAILWATCH
====================

Username is “mailwatch” password is “afnog”

Please note that Chrome may not be able to login so try another browser if that is the case.

	https://pcX.sse.ws.afnog.org/mailwatch



PLEASE NOTE: In the real world this page _MUST_ be accessed over HTTPS and as was mentioned earlier, the username should be changed and the password made more difficult to guess.
