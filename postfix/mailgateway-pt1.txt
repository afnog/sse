!!!!!!!IMPORTANT INFO!!!!!!!
===========================

SETTING UP A PROPER AND SECURE EMAIL FILTER TAKES A LONG TIME AND MUCH OF THE SETUP FOR THE CLASS HAS BEEN PRE-CONFIGURED FOR THE SAKE OF TIME. 

THE CONFIGURATIONS FOR THIS COURSE HAVE BEEN HIGHLY SIMPLIFIED AND YOU SHOULD TAKE TIME TO READ MORE ABOUT POSTFIX, MAILSCANNER, SPAMASSASIN, CLAM ANTIVIRUS AND MAILWATCH BEFORE DEPLOYING A SERVER IN THE REAL WORLD. 

LINKS TO THE INDIVIDUAL SOFTWARES:

MailWatch:	http://mailwatch.org
SpamAssassin:	http://spamassassin.apache.org/
Clam Antivirus:	http://www.clamav.net/index.html
Postfix:	http://www.postfix.org/

!!!!YOU MUST REGULARLY UPDATE ALL SOFTWARES TO RECEIVE NEW PATCHES AND SECURITY UPDATES!!!!


READ ABOUT FRESHCLAM (FOR UPDATING CLAM ANTIVIRUS) AND SA-UPDATE (FOR UPDATING SPAMASSASSIN)

ALSO, YOU SHOULD READ ABOUT CONFIGURING GREYLISTING, DKIM AND SPF VERIFICATION ON POSTFIX!

IF YOU WANT TO SET UP A MAIL FILTER FOR YOUR NETWORK, YOU SHOULD CREATE A TEST DOMAIN TO RECEIVE EMAILS BEFORE DIRECTING YOUR EMAILS VIA THE FILTER OTHERWISE YOU MAY LOSE EMAILS. 

THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE WORKING MX RECORDS

From http://mailscanner.info:

You may have read somewhere on Postfix.org that MailScanner shouldn’t be used with Postfix. This is not true. The people at Postfix insist we should use a milter instead of direct file management. The bottom line is that MailScanner has worked flawlessly with Postfix for over a decade.
