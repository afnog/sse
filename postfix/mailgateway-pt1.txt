READ ABOUT FRESHCLAM (FOR UPDATING CLAM ANTIVIRUS) AND SA-UPDATE (FOR UPDATING SPAMASSASSIN)

ALSO, YOU SHOULD READ ABOUT CONFIGURING GREYLISTING, DKIM AND SPF VERIFICATION ON POSTFIX!

IF YOU WANT TO SET UP A MAIL FILTER FOR YOUR NETWORK, YOU SHOULD CREATE A TEST DOMAIN TO RECEIVE EMAILS BEFORE DIRECTING YOUR EMAILS VIA THE FILTER OTHERWISE YOU MAY LOSE EMAILS. 

THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE WORKING MX RECORDS

From http://mailscanner.info:

You may have read somewhere on Postfix.org that MailScanner shouldnâ€™t be used with Postfix. This is not true. The people at Postfix insist we should use a milter instead of direct file management. The bottom line is that MailScanner has worked flawlessly with Postfix for over a decade.
