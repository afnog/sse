Dovecot Exercice

We are going to install Dovecot 2 on the Debian Virtual server assigned to each participant to enable IMAP and POP3 handling

1. Installing Dovecot on Debian

1.1 Run the following command at the command prompt

afnog@pcXX:~$ sudo apt-get install dovecot-core dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d dovecot-lmtpd

2. How to check the Dovecot Config

afnog@pcXX:~$ doveconf -n

3. Configuring Dovecot - change directory to the Dovecot conf.d folder

afnog@pcXX:~$ cd /etc/dovecot/conf.d/

4. There are two types of mailbox storage formats namely Mbox and Maildir. In Mbox all mails are stored as a single file with new emails being appended at the end of the file. In Maildir format, all emails are stored as individual files. Verify that the mail format is Mbox and location is /var/mail/"user" by reviewing the file 10-mail.conf

afnog@pcXX:/etc/dovecot/conf.d$ sudo nano 10-mail.conf


4.1 In the same file 10-mail.conf we need to give Dovecot permission to read/access the /var/mail folder. Find the line below;

#mail_privileged_group =

4.2 Uncomment the line in 4.3 above and add group "mail" to have access to it.

mail_privileged_group = mail


4.3 Save and Close/Exit the file 10-mail.conf 

5. Define the Dovecot services and the permissions by editing the file 10-master.conf file. Open the 10-master.conf file

afnog@pcXX:/etc/dovecot/conf.d$ sudo nano 10-master.conf


5.1 Enable the Unix Listener using the Postfix username and password. This allows Postfix to use Dovecost for SMTP Authentication. Find these lines inside the file 10-master.conf;

  #unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
  #  mode = 0666
  #}

5.2 Uncomment the 3 lines (inside the 10-master.conf) and add the user and group to be postfix before the last curly bracket as below; 

unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
    mode = 0666
    user = postfix
    group = postfix
  }

5.3 Save and Close/Exit the file 10-master.conf 

6.0 The Dovecot Authentication Mechanisms are stored in the 10-auth.conf file. Any changes to password formats, SSL configurations, etc are made in this file

afnog@pcXX:/etc/dovecot/conf.d$ sudo nano 10-auth.conf


6.1  Plaintext authentication is disabled by default. We need to enable plaintext authentication to be able to carry out tests. Best practice is to have them disabled.  Find the below line and change the default which blocks plaintext_authentication

#disable_plaintext_auth = yes

6.2 Uncomment the line  (inside the 10-auth.conf file) and change yes to no;

disable_plaintext_auth = no

6.3 Save and Close/Exit the file 10-auth.conf 

7.0 Configure Dovecot to use the the System users. Dovecot can be configured to authenticate using various user passwords and databases. The auth-system.conf.ext is an extension of 10-auth.conf and defines how Dovecot should access the System users. Open the file auth-system.conf.ext

afnog@pcXX:/etc/dovecot/conf.d$ sudo vi auth-system.conf.ext


7.1 Configure Dovecot to use PAM Authentication to access the System Users by finding and modifying the line below;

passdb {
  driver = pam
  # [session=yes] [setcred=yes] [failure_show_msg=yes] [max_requests=<n>]
  # [cache_key=<key>] [<service name>]
  #args = dovecot
}


7.2 Uncomment the args line (inside the auth-system.conf.ext file) as below. This tells Dovecot to use the configuration is /etc/pam.d/dovecot which has information on the PAM libraries to use. 

passdb {
  driver = pam
  # [session=yes] [setcred=yes] [failure_show_msg=yes] [max_requests=<n>]
  # [cache_key=<key>] [<service name>]
  args = dovecot
}

5.3 Save and Close/Exit the file auth-system.conf.ext

8.0 After making those changes we need to restart Dovecot

afnog@pcXX:/etc/dovecot/conf.d$ sudo service dovecot restart


9.0 You can now go into your personal or official work email address and send an email to afnog@________.afnog.guru


10.0 Test to make sure that you can login to Dovecot and check email from your machine or any other place

afnog@pcXX:/etc/dovecot/conf.d$ telnet pcXX.sse.ws.afnog.org 110
