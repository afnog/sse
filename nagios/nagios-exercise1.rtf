Nagios Installation and Configuration

Notes:
------
* Commands preceded with "$" imply that you should execute the command as
  a general user - not as root.
* Commands preceded with "#" imply that you should be working as root.
* Commands with more specific command lines (e.g. "RTR-GW>" or "mysql>") 
  imply that you are executing commands on remote equipment, or within 
  another program.

Exercises
---------

PART I
----------------

0. Log in to your virtual machine as the sysadm user.

1. Install Nagios Version 3
---------------------------

Become the root user:

	$ sudo bash
	# apt-get install nagios3 nagios3-doc

During installation you will be prompted for the "Nagios web administration password:" - This
will be for the Nagios user "nagiosadmin". When prompted enter in ÒafnogÓ as the password.

Note: if you have not already done so, you may be asked to configure
the Postfix Mail Transport Agent during the Nagios installation process.
Just accept the default "Internet Site".

2. See Initial Nagios Configuration
------------------------------------

Open a browser, and go to your machine like this:

	http://pcX.sse.ws.afnog.org/nagios3/

At the login prompt, login as:

        User Name: nagiosadmin
        Password:  afnog

Click on the "Hosts" link on the left of the initial Nagios page to see what has
already been configured.


3. Update the File hostgroups_nagios2.cfg
-----------------------------------------

	# cd /etc/nagios3/conf.d
	# nano hostgroups_nagios2.cfg

The file contains some default entries. Locate the line starting with:
â€œ# A list of your Debian GNU/Linux serversâ€

Add 5 servers to be monitored so that the entry looks like follows:


# A list of your Debian GNU/Linux servers
define hostgroup {
        hostgroup_name  debian-servers
                alias           Debian GNU/Linux Servers
                members         localhost,server1,server2,server3,server4,server5
        }


Now save and exit the from the file.


4. Add Routers and Servers
--------------------------------

We will create two files, routers.cfg and servers.cfg and make
entries for the hardware in our classroom.


5a. Creating the routers.cfg file
---------------------------------

We will have 2 routers and assume that one router is the external device in the network gw-rtr-1 and that to get to it, one must go to gw-rtr-2. We will define that by having gw-rtr-1 as the parent of gw-rtr-2.
Remember, COPY and PASTE!

	# nano routers.cfg



define host {
    use         generic-host
    host_name   gw-rtr-1
    alias       Classrooom Gateway Router
    address     197.4.11.140
}


define host {
    use         generic-host
    host_name   gw-rtr-2
    alias       Classrooom Gateway Router
    address     197.4.11.139
    parents     gw-rtr-1
}



Now save and exit from the file.


5b. Creating the servers.cfg File
-----------------------------

Now we will create entries for 5 servers. Below 
we give you the first few entries. You can complete the file with as many Servers
as you wish to add. We recommend that, at least, you add the 5 PCs and define gw-rtr-2 as the parent of each server (remember to COPY and PASTE!):

	# nano servers.cfg



define host {
    use         generic-host
    host_name   server1
    alias       pc1
    address     197.4.11.101
    parents	gw-rtr-2
}

define host {
    use         generic-host
    host_name   server2
    alias       pc2
    address     197.4.11.102
    parents	gw-rtr-2
}

define host {
    use         generic-host
    host_name   server3
    alias       pc3
    address     197.4.11.103
    parents	gw-rtr-2
}

define host {
    use         generic-host
    host_name   server4
    alias       pc4
    address     197.4.11.104
    parents	gw-rtr-2
}


define host {
    use         generic-host
    host_name   server5
    alias       pc5
    address     197.4.11.105
    parents	gw-rtr-2
}

You can save and exit from the file now, or you can continue to add more PC entries.
If you have not added PCs for your group be sure to do that before you exit from the
file.





STEPS 6a - 6c SHOULD BE REPEATED WHENEVER YOU UPDATE THE CONFIGURATION!
=======================================================================
    
6a. Verify that your configuration files are OK
-----------------------------------------------

	# nagios3 -v /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg 


    ... You should get some warnings like :

Checking services...
	Checked 7 services.
Checking hosts...
Warning: Host 'gw-rtr-1â€™ has no services associated with it!


etc....
...
Total Warnings: N
Total Errors:   0

Things look okay - No serious problems were detected during the check.
Nagios is saying that it's unusual to monitor a device just for its
existence on the network, without also monitoring some service.


6b. Reload/Restart Nagios
-------------------------

	# service nagios3 restart

HINT: You will be doing this a lot. If you do it all on one line, like this,
then you can hit cursor-up and rerun all in one go:

	

6c. Verify via the Web Interface
--------------------------------

Go to the web interface (http://pcX.sse.ws.afnog.org/nagios3) and check that the hosts 
you just added are now visible in the interface. Click on the "Hosts" item on the
left of the Nagios screen to see this. You may see it in "PENDING" status until the
check is carried out.


7. View Status Map
--------------------

Go to http://pcX.sse.ws.afnog.org/nagios3

Click on the "Map" item on the left. You should see all your hosts with the Nagios
process in the middle with gw-rtr-2 in the middle



PART II
Configure Service check for DNS and Radius
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Configuring

Now that we have our hardware configured we can start telling Nagios what services to monitor
on the configured hardware, how to group the hardware in interesting ways, how to group
services, etc.

1. Associate a service check for our servers. We will monitor 2 services: DNS and Radius

    # nano hostgroups_nagios2.cfg

    - add the following at the end of the file:

# A list of your DNS servers
define hostgroup {
        hostgroup_name  dns-servers
                alias           DNS servers
                members         localhost,server1,server2,server3,server4,server5
        }


# A list of your Radius servers
define hostgroup {
        hostgroup_name  radius-servers
                alias           Radius servers
                members         localhost,server1,server2,server3,server4,server5
	}

# A list of your Routers servers
define hostgroup {
        hostgroup_name  my-routers
                alias           Routers
                members         gw-rtr-1,gw-rtr-2
        }

# A list of your Web servers
define hostgroup {
        hostgroup_name  web-servers
                alias           Web servers
                members         localhost,server1,server2,server3,server4,server5

	}
# A list of your HTTPS servers
define hostgroup {
        hostgroup_name  https-servers
                alias           HTTPS servers
                members         localhost,server1,server2,server3,server4,server5

	}

Exit and save the file. 




Now edit services-nagios.cfg and add the new service for DNS and Radius check
	


	# nano services_nagios2.cfg


# check that DNS services are running
define service {
        hostgroup_name                  dns-servers
        service_description             DNS
        check_command                   check_dns
        use                             generic-service
        notification_interval           0 ; set > 0 if you want to be renotified
}

# check that Radius services are running
define service {
        hostgroup_name                  radius-servers
        service_description             Radius
        check_command                   check_radius
        use                             generic-service
        notification_interval           0 ; set > 0 if you want to be renotified


# check that Web services are running
define service {
        hostgroup_name                  web-servers
        service_description             HTTP Service
        check_command                   check_http
        use                             generic-service
        notification_interval           0 ; set > 0 if you want to be renotified
}


# check that Web services are running
define service {
        hostgroup_name                  https-servers
        service_description             HTTPS service
        check_command                   check_https
        use                             generic-service
        notification_interval           0 ; set > 0 if you want to be renotified
}


Verify that your changes are OK:

	# nagios3 -v /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg
	
Restart Nagios to see the new service association with your host:

	# service nagios3 restart

Click on the "Services" link in the Nagios web interface to see your new entries





========ADDITIONAL - Configuring the map icons======

Nags ships with a few logos for generic devices like routers and switches that will appear on the map. Let us change the icon for the 2 routers


		# nano extinfo_nagios2.cfg



define hostextinfo{
        hostgroup_name   my-routers
        notes            Routers
#       notes_url        http://webserver.localhost.localdomain/hostinfo.pl?host=netware1
        icon_image       base/router40.png
        icon_image_alt   Debian GNU/Linux
        vrml_image       router40.png
        statusmap_image  base/router40.gd2
        }



Save and Exit the file



Check that the config is ok


		#nagios3 -v /etc/nagios3/conf.d/nagios.cfg


Then reload Nagios
		

		#service nagios3 restart
