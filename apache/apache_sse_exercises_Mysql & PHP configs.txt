Configuring MySQL5 and PHP5 & Installation of Wordpress
=======================================================

1. Configuring MySQL:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
1.1 Enable the mysql service by issuing the following command.

	# update-rc.d mysql enable


1.2 Start the mysql server using command below

	# service mysql start


1.3 Setting the Mysql Admin password and security we use the following procedure 

* Please read the instructions and use the letters y or n on the keyboard.

	# mysql_secure_installation

The password to set for mysql is afnog

Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y                                            
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] n
... Success!

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!

 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

Cleaning up...

1.4. Log in to mysql console to check if the password was set properly using command below.

	# mysql -u root -p
	Password:

     Type the password at the prompt.

     You can exit from the mysql> prompt by typing “exit” command


2. Configuring PHP:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 PHP Configuration

    Settings for PHP are stored in the /etc/php5/php.ini file.


2.2 Copy the distribution file by issuing the following command

	# cp /etc/php.ini-development /usr/local/etc/php.ini


2.3 Edit /usr/local/etc/php.ini and uncomment the following:

	; display_errors
	   Default Value: On
	   Development Value: On
	;   Production Value: Off
	
	; display_startup_errors
	   Default Value: Off
	   Development Value: On
	;   Production Value: Off
	
	; error_reporting
	   Default Value: E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED
	   Development Value: E_ALL
	;   Production Value: E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT
	
	; html_errors
	   Default Value: On
	   Development Value: On
	;   Production value: On
	
	; log_errors
	   Default Value: Off
	   Development Value: On
	;   Production Value: On
   
   Save and exit php.ini


3.4 Also Apache needs to be configured, so it can use php.

	# cd /usr/local/etc/apache22/
	# ee httpd.conf

    Scroll down to the end of the /usr/local/etc/apache22/httpd.conf and add the following lines.

	DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm
	AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
	AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

     Save and exit the apache configuration file.

3.5 Restart apache to check if you have any errors

	# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache22 restart

	Output:
	Performing sanity check on apache24 configuration:
	Syntax OK
	Stopping apache22.
	Waiting for PIDS: 61539.
	Performing sanity check on apache24 configuration:
	Syntax OK
	Starting apache22.


3.6 To test PHP, create the following file in the apache 

	# echo "<? phpinfo(); ?>" >> /usr/local/www/apache22/data/test.php

     Now check the phpinfo page http://<your-server-ip>/test.php
