Configuring MySQL5 and PHP5 & Installation of Wordpress
=======================================================

1. Configuring MySQL:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
1.1 Enable the mysql service by issuing the following command.

	# sudo update-rc.d mysql enable


1.2 Start the mysql server using command below

	# sudo service mysql start


1.3 Setting the Mysql Admin password and security we use the following procedure 

* Please read the instructions and use the letters “y” or “n” on the keyboard.

	# sudo mysql_secure_installation

The password to set for mysql is afnog

Enter current password for root (enter for none): 
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y                                            
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] n
... Success!

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
 - Dropping test database...
 ... Success!

 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

Cleaning up...

1.4. Log in to mysql console to check if the password was set properly using command below.

	# mysql -u root -p
