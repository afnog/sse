If you're running a workshop, try this game:

* Works best if there's an even number of people on each table.
* Divide the group into pairs.
* Ask the group to put their hands up if they're paired with someone they
already know.
* "If your hand is up and you're left of the person you know, stand up and
  move to the front."
* "Now sit down next to someone you don't know."
* Repeat to check that everyone's paired with someone they don't know.
* Each pair has 2 minutes to get to know the person next to them. Should make notes.
* Then they have to introduce the other person in their pair.
