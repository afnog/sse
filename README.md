# AfNOG 2014 Workshop on Network Technology

## Track SS-E: Scalable Internet Services

This course on Scalable Internet Services is part of the
[AfNOG 2014 Workshop on Network Technology](http://www.ws.afnog.org/afnog2014/),
held in conjunction with the [AfNOG meeting](http://www.afnog.org/)
in Djibouti, May-June 2014.

We use hands-on training in a well-equipped classroom over a five-day period
to teach skills required for the configuration and operation of large scale
Internet services.

During workshop week, materials and notes for the SS-E workshop track are
being maintained on GitHub. Please proceed to the
