## What will we do?

.fill[[![OpenStack Havana Architecture](openstack_havana_conceptual_arch.png)](http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/ch_overview.html)]

---
## Why are we doing it?

Rapid deployments

* Redundancy
* Fault tolerance
* Scalability
* Managed by [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/)

???

Juju can provision virtual machines (nodes) on:

* commercial providers (e.g. EC2)
* our OpenStack cluster
* bare metal (MAAS)

---
## How will we do it?

* Create 3 virtual machines (nodes)
* Install Ubuntu
* Install OpenStack "Kilo" components
  * Roughly following the instructions at:
    http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/index.html
* Requirements: A PC with 4 GB RAM, 20 GB free disk space

**Warning:** the procedure described here is highly customised for this demonstration. For a real deployment you should follow
the installation guide linked above.

---
## Install VirtualBox

* You can find installers and packages at: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

---
## Create Networks

.fill[[![Minimal architecture example with OpenStack Networking (neutron)â€”Network layout](installguidearch-neutron-networks.png)](http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/ch_basic_environment.html)]

---
## Create Networks

Open *Settings > Network*:

.height_8em[![Adding NAT networks](add-networks.png)]

* Create four NAT networks:
  * "External" - 10.196.1.0/24
  * "Management" - 10.196.2.0/24
  * "Tunnel" - 10.196.3.0/24
  * "Storage" - 10.196.4.0/24

---
## Create a Virtual Machine

* Named "OpenStack Compute 1"
  * One of our three nodes, the Compute Node
* Allocate 1024 MB RAM, 20 GB disk space
  * Name the disk image "Trusty OpenStack"
* Configure network devices:
  * Interface 1: Management
  * Interface 2: Tunnel
  * Interface 3: Storage

---
## Install Ubuntu

* Do not install updates yet!
* Normally would use the server edition and drive from command line
* In a virtual machine, the GUI makes it easier to manage (until SSH is up)

---
## Enable cache

Start the virtual machine and log in.

Check that you can ping the Apt cache server:

	$ ping mini1.sse.ws.afnog.org
	PING mini1.sse.ws.afnog.org (197.4.15.144): 56 data bytes
	64 bytes from 197.4.15.144: icmp_seq=0 ttl=63 time=1.434 ms

Sudo edit `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy` and add:

	Acquire::http::Proxy "http://197.4.11.251:3142";

---
## Install the Kilo repository

Sudo edit `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudarchive-kilo.list` and add:

	deb http://ubuntu-cloud.archive.canonical.com/ubuntu trusty-updates/kilo main

Then execute:

	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-cloud-keyring ntp openssh-server nano
	$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

And shut down the machine.

---
## Share the disk

Use Virtual Media Manager to:

* Release the disk (detach from virtual machine)
* Modify > Multi-attach

Then reattach to virtual machine:

* Settings > Storage > Controller: SATA
* Click *Add new attachment* icon below
* Choose *Add hard disk*
* *Choose existing disk*
* Choose the *Trusty Openstack* disk image

---
## Create the Controller Node

1024 MB RAM, use existing disk image.

Configure network devices:
* Interface 1: Management

---
## Create the Network Node

1024 MB RAM, use existing disk image.

Configure network devices:

* Interface 1: Management
* Interface 2: Tunnel
* Interface 3: External
  * Change the *Promiscuous Mode* to *Allow all*

---
## Hostnames and IP addresses

* Start all three virtual machines (nodes)
* Change their hostnames to be unique:
  * controller.local
  * network.local
  * compute1.local
* Note their IP addresses on all interfaces (networks)

---
## Setup port forwarding

* Open *VirtualBox Settings > Network > External*
* Click on the screwdriver (to the right)
* Click *Port Forwarding*
* Add entries named after the machine plus "SSH"
* Set local port to:
  * "2201" for the controller node
  * "2202" for network
  * "2203" for compute 1
* Set guest IP to the host IP address on management network
* Set guest port to 22

???
Forward local ports to each of your node's management IPs, for easier remote management.
---

## Setup port forwarding

.fill[![Adding port forwarding](port-forwarding.png)]

---
## Connect with SSH

Start SSH sessions in three separate terminals to:

* Controller: localhost port 2201
* Network: localhost port 2202
* Compute: localhost port 2203

You should be able to:

* see them all
* identify which is which
* switch easily between them.

---
## Create /etc/hosts

Normally you would set up DNS entries for all machines. In a test environment it's easier to use a `hosts` file.

Create a `hosts` file with the name of each node and its **management** interface address:

	127.0.0.1	localhost
	10.196.1.x	controller.local
	10.196.1.y	network.local
	10.196.1.z	compute1.local

Copy this file to each computer, replacing its original `/etc/hosts`.

---
## Verify connectivity

Check that each node can ping the Internet and all other nodes:

	$ ping 8.8.8.8
	$ ping controller.local
	$ ping network.local
	$ ping compute1.local

---
### Follow the instructions

Start following the OpenStack Kilo installation guide:

* Use the [Security](http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/ch_basic_environment.html#basics-security) to create a password.
  * Use this password for everything ending in `PASS`.
* Skip the *Networking* step, already done.
* Skip the *OpenStack packages* step, already done.
* Remember to prefix most commands with `sudo`.
