## What will we do?

.fill[[![OpenStack Havana Architecture](openstack_havana_conceptual_arch.png)](http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/ch_overview.html)]

---

## Why are we doing it?

Rapid deployments

* Redundancy
* Fault tolerance
* Scalability
* Managed by [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/)

???

Juju can provision virtual machines on:

* commercial providers (e.g. EC2)
* our OpenStack cluster
* bare metal (MAAS)

---

## How will we do it?

* Create 3 virtual machines
* Install Ubuntu
* Install OpenStack "Kilo" components
  * Roughly following the instructions at:
    http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/install-guide/install/apt/content/index.html
* Requirements: A PC with 4 GB RAM, 20 GB free disk space

---

## Install VirtualBox

* You can find installers and packages at: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

---

## Create Networks

---

## Create Networks

* Create one NAT network:
  * "External"
* And three host-only networks:
  * "Management"
  * "Tunnel"
  * "Storage"

---

## Create a Virtual Machine

* Named "Trusty OpenStack Compute"
  * One of our three virtual machines, the Compute Node
* Allocate 1 GB RAM, 20 GB disk space
* Configure networks:
  * Interface 1: Management
  * Interface 2: Tunnel
  * Interface 3: Storage

---

## Install Ubuntu

* Do not install updates yet!
* Normally would use the server edition and drive from command line
* In a virtual machine, the GUI makes it easier to manage

---

## Install Ubuntu

Remember: do not install updates!

class: center, middle, inverse

Any questions?
