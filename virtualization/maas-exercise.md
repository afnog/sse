# MAAS Exercise

MAAS is not a virtualisation system. It's an OS deployment tool. We will use it later to deploy
software quickly, such as OpenStack, which we can use for virtualisation.

MAAS is normally installed on physical machines. We don't have enough physical machines, so we
will use virtual machines in this lab.

## Install the MAAS Controller

Every MAAS setup requires a controller server. Needs about 20 GB disk space (for OS images to deploy)
and 2 GB RAM. (why?)

Install VirtualBox. 

> If you already have VirtualBox installed, please note that we are going to disable DHCP on the
> Host Network Adapter vboxnet1. Please check whether any of your virtual machines are using this adapter.
> If they are, please choose a different one in the following examples.

Open VirtualBox Preferences > Network > Host-Only Adaptors > vboxnet1 and disable the DHCP server:

Create a new VM called MAAS Controller. Give it 1 GB RAM and a 40 GB VDI disk,
dynamically sized.

### Starting Installation

Start the VM and attach the Ubuntu 14.04 Server 64-bit CD. Choose the *Multiple server installation
with MAAS* option:

### MAAS Option

When asked which MAAS server to use, choose *Create a new MAAS server on this instance*.

### Partitioning

The MAAS server needs more memory than you might want, so we need to give it a big swap space.

Instead of the default *Guided Partitioning*, choose *Manual*, then *SCSI3*, then:

* Select *pri/log free space*, *Create a new partition*, 40 GB, *Primary*, *Beginning*, *Done*.
* Select *pri/log free space*, *Create a new partition*, 2.9 GB (approx), *Logical*, *Use as* > *Swap area*, *Done*.
* Finish and Write changes to disk.

###Â Proxy Server

When asked for a proxy server, enter this one (to save a LONG install time):

* http://197.4.11.251:3142

### After Installation

After installation, shut down the machine and reconfigure its network interfaces in VirtualBox

* Adapter 1: Bridged to your Wireless NIC (if that doesn't work, you can use the loopback interface
  with Internet Connection Sharing that you created for GNS3)

* Adapter 2: Host-only network, vboxnet0, enable Promiscuous Mode.

![Configuring Network Adaptor 1](virtualbox-configure-adaptor-2.png)

Then start the machine again. Log in on the console and edit `/etc/network/interfaces` to look like this:

	# The loopback network interface
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback

	# The primary network interface
	auto eth0
	iface eth0 inet dhcp
		post-up ip addr add dev eth0 10.0.2.15

	auto eth1
	iface eth1 inet static
		address 192.168.57.1
		netmask 255.255.255.0

Then run the following commands:

	sudo ifdown eth0
	sudo ifup eth0
	sudo ifup eth1
	ifconfig eth0

And write down the IP address of eth0. Then continue with the following commands:

	sudo apt-get install patch
	cd /
	wget -O- http://197.4.11.251/utils.patch | sudo patch -p0
	sudo maas-region-admin createsuperuser
	sudo http_proxy=http://197.4.11.251:3128/ maas-import-pxe-files

The last command will take some time to run, you can leave it running.

Open http://ip-address/MAAS in a browser on your laptop and you should be able to log in.

Go to *Clusters > Cluster master > Add interface* and configure it like this:

* Interface: eth1
* Management: Manage DHCP and DNS
* IP: 192.168.57.1
* Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
* Router IP: 192.168.57.1
* IP range low: 192.168.57.100
* IP range high: 192.168.57.200

And click on *Save interface*. Then use the console to reboot the server.

## Install a Node

In VirtualBox create a new VM called MAAS Node 1. Give it 1 GB RAM and a 40 GB VDI disk,
dynamically sized.

Configure its network Adapter 1 to use a Host-Only network, and select *vboxnet1*.
